# Fingerprint to Blood Group Prediction

This project leverages deep learning to predict an individual's blood group based on their fingerprint image. The model uses ResNet9 architecture, which is deployed via a Streamlit web application for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or above.
2. Required libraries installed (listed in `requirements.txt`).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fingerprint-to-blood-group.git
   cd fingerprint-to-blood-group
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the pre-trained model file `FingurePrintTOBloodGroup.pth` in the project directory.

4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_resnet.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Model Architecture
The model is based on the ResNet9 architecture, designed for efficient and accurate image classification tasks.

### Steps
1. **Image Upload**:
   - Users upload a fingerprint image in formats like PNG, JPG, JPEG, or BMP.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The image is resized to 128x128 pixels and normalized for model compatibility.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The model processes the image and predicts the blood group among 8 possible classes.

4. **Output**:
   - The result is displayed on the screen, along with the uploaded fingerprint.
